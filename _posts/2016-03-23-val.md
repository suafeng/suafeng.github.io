### val
{% highlight scala %}
val greetStrings = new Array[String](3)
greetStrings(0) = "Hello"
greetStrings(1) = " world!"
{% endhighlight %}

When you define a variable with val, the variable cannot be reassigned, but the object to which it refer could potentially still be changed. So in this case, you couldn't reassign greetStrings to a different array; greetStrings will always point to the same Array[String] instance with which it was initialized. But you can change the elements of the Array[String] over time, so the array itself is mutable. (Programming in Scala, p38-p39)
